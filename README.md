# State-Monad

State-Monad is a Python library that encapsulates stateful computations into a monadic structure.

## Features

* Pragmatic Monad: Implements the core concepts of a state monad in a way that is practical and relevant for a Python developpers. It focus on usability rather than enforcing strict adherence to monadic laws.
* Object-Orgiented Design: State monad operations are built using Python classes, favoring an object-oriented approach that works with data and objects rather than relying on deeply nested functions.
* Type hinting: Full support for type hinting ensures that types are correctly inferred by type checkers like [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).

## Installation

You can install Do-notation using pip:

```
pip install statemonad
```

## Overview

The state object (also referred to as a context) is a Python object that represents the state in your computations.
Each operation may modify the state and return a new values based on the updated state.
The result is a chain of operations where the state flows through each step, with the State-Monad keeping the flow clean and organized.

## Example

<!-- The following example illustrates the use of the State-Monad library. -->
In this example, we define the `collect_even_numbers` operations, which returns a `CollectEvenNumbers` state monad if the given number is even, or a default state monad encapsulating the value otherwise.
The `example` function performs monadic operations using the `collect_even_numbers` operator, resulting in a state monad.
Finally, the constructed state monad is applied with an empty tuple as the initial state.


``` python
from dataclassabc import dataclassabc

import statemonad
from statemonad.abc import StateMonadNode
from statemonad import init_state_monad


type State = tuple[int, ...]
state = tuple()


def collect_even_numbers(num: int):
    """
    This function encapsulates the given number within a state monad 
    and saves it to the state if the number is even.
    """
    
    if num % 2 == 0:

        @dataclassabc(frozen=True)
        class CollectEvenNumbers(StateMonadNode[State, int]):
            num: int

            def apply(self, state: State):
                n_state = state + (self.num,)
                return n_state, self.num

        return init_state_monad(CollectEvenNumbers(num=num))

    else:
        return statemonad.from_[State](num)

# do some monadic operations using `flat_map`
def example(init):
    return collect_even_numbers(init + 1).flat_map(
        lambda x: collect_even_numbers(x + 1).flat_map(
            lambda y: collect_even_numbers(y + 1).flat_map(
                lambda z: collect_even_numbers(z + 1)
            )
        )
    )

monad = example(3)

# Output will be
# monad=StateMonadImpl(
#   child=FlatMapImpl(
#       child=CollectEvenNumbers(num=4),
#   func=<function example.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x000001A546B53D80>))
print(f"{monad=}")

state, value = monad.apply(state)

print(f"{value=}")  # Output will be value=7
print(f"{state=}")  # Output will be state=(4, 6)
```

Defining the `CollectEvenNumbers` state monad as a class allows for a clean and readable representation of the resulting Python object.
However, some details of this representation is obscured by the lambda function used with the `flat_map` method.


## Do-notation

Using the donotation library, the monadic sequence above can be rewritten with the do-notation as follows:

``` python
@do()
def example(init):
    x = yield from collect_even_numbers(init + 1)
    y = yield from collect_even_numbers(x + 1)
    z = yield from collect_even_numbers(y + 1)
    return collect_even_numbers(z + 1)
```



<!-- The following example illustrates how a state object `state` is created and used to compute an object `result`:


``` python
def compute_something(state):
    state, val1 = operation1(state)
    state, val2 = operation2(val1, state)
    state, result = operation2(val1, val2, state)
    return state, result

# Create state object used in the preceding computations.
state = init_state()

state, result1 = compute_something(state)
```

If we recompute the object, we can either use the same state object `state`,

``` python
# result2 might be different from result1, that is result1 != result3
state, result2 = compute_something(state)
```

or, we can create a new state object `state` resulting in the same object `result` as before:

``` python
# Create the same state object as before
state = init_state()

# result 1 == result 3
state, result3 = compute_something(state)
```
 -->
